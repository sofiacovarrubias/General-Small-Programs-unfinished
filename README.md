# General-Small-Programs
Small and basic programs I have created either inspired by a homework problem or for simple functions. 
These are written in Python 3.7 and use very basic packages such as numpy.
If you find any issues, or have any suggestions on how to streamline my code please let me know! 
I am more than happy to hear any suggestions
